    <p>Taking part in our competitions requires a significantly monetary investment from the team. To successfully compete in 2015 we need to acquire funding for parts, transportation, and entry fees. For the 2015 season, our competitions are hosted in a variety of locations across North America. Our team welcomes all forms of contribution to the team, be it financial, service-related or product-based.</p>

	<p>Over the past 10 years, our sponsors have enjoyed a mutually beneficial relationship with the UW Robotics Team. Our supporters gain visibility on the University of Waterloo campus, at the competitions we visit, and throughout the Kitchener-Waterloo region. Additionally, sponsors gain access to our pool of talented students for recruitment purposes.</p>
